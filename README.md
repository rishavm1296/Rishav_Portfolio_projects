Hi there, Welcome to my profile.I'm sharing my projects that I worked on. In one project, I predicted the stock price using the S&P 500 data from the yahoo finance library. I used the Random Forest Machine learning algorithm, I also utilised the various other library such as Numpy and Pandas for the data transformation, SkLearn for the machine learning. 
In other projects, I worked on SQL, and created the Dashboard using Power BI.
