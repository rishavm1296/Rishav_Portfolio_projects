Hi there, Welcome to my profile.I'm sharing my projects that I worked on. In one project, I predicted the stock price using the S&P 500 data from the yahoo finance library. I used the Random Forest Machine learning algorithm, I also utilised the various other library such as Numpy and Pandas for the data transformation, SkLearn for the machine learning. 
In other projects, I worked on SQL, and created the Dashboard using Power BI.
In my capstone project, I developed a web-based book recommender system using collaborative filtering machine learning algorithm with Python libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. This project involves rigorous data cleaning and employs machine learning to deliver personalized book recommendations. Additionally, I leveraged the web development skills like Python, bootstrap, HTML, CSS creating an interactive website platform for users to access and engage with the recommendation system. This project showcases my skills in data science and web development, merging machine learning with practical applications for user-centric experiences. Please find the Jupyter notebook file as well as the code for the app that I created, along with the Bootstrap HTML files.
